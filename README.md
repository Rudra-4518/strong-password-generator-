# Strong Password Generator (Flask)

This is a simple web application built with Flask (Python) that generates strong passwords based on user-specified criteria.  It allows users to select the desired password length and include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.  A copy-to-clipboard feature is also included for convenience.

## Features

*   **Customizable Length:** Users can specify the desired length of the password.
*   **Character Type Selection:** Users can choose which character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
*   **Copy to Clipboard:** The generated password can be easily copied to the clipboard with a single click.
*   **Responsive Design:** Basic responsive design principles are applied to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Core programming language.
*   **Flask:** Web framework for creating the web application.
*   **HTML:** Markup language for structuring the web page.
*   **CSS:** Styling language for visual presentation.
